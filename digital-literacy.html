<h3 style="text-indent: 0px;">DIGITAL LITERACY</h3><br />
<p2 style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 50px">"The ability to leverage media literacies and knowledge of information and communications technology, and relevant interpersonal skills, to succeed in a digital space. Digital literacy means assessing sources of information, using technologies responsibly, adapting tools to new purposes, and keeping up with the evolving technology landscape."</p2>

<h3 style="text-indent: 0px;">PERSONAL LEARNING NETWORK</h3><br />
<p2 style="margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 2.5em;">The network of resources that support your learning-- the people, organizations, technologies, spaces, communities, etc. that you leverage as a learner. <br /><br />I decided that I wanted to update my Personal Learning Network map to see the differences in how I have grown and how my perception of available networks has changed. I felt as though I have learned a lot of new tools and skills this year which has greatly increased my competency and confidence in what I do. Compared to my original PLN and reflection, I am still proud of the Professional Connections I have acquired. I was able to expand upon it further the past few months by joining the TCAB Mentor Program and being assigned a Mentor. Though we have had little time to chat thus far, I am excited for the prospects of gaining advice and knowledge on how I can best advance my career. In my original reflection, I noted that I was excited to expand the "Other" section for my network. Looking at how I arranged my PLN now, I feel as though I have made a good start on gaining more experience with different digital platforms. It is amazing to think of how much growth I have made in just one semester. As someone who is constantly pushing themself to newer, greater goals, I look forward to continually growing in these areas, gaining new areas to add to my network, as well as find new opportunities for growth in my workplace and professional organizations.</p2>
